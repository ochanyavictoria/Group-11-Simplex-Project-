## Code Structure
The program is structured into a single C++ class (`Simplex`) and a `main` function. The `Simplex` class contains methods to initialize the tableau, compute \( C_j - Z_j \) values, find pivot columns and rows, perform pivot operations, and solve the LPP.

Below is a breakdown of the code structure:

### Class: `Simplex`
The `Simplex` class encapsulates the logic for solving Linear Programming Problems using the Simplex Algorithm. It contains the following key components:

#### Attributes
- `numVariables`: Number of decision variables in the LPP.
- `numConstraints`: Number of constraints in the LPP.
- `tableau`: A 2D vector representing the Simplex tableau.
- `basicVariables`: A vector storing the indices of basic variables.
- `isMaximization`: A boolean flag indicating whether the problem is a maximization or minimization problem.

#### Methods
1. **`initializeTableau`**:
   - Initializes the Simplex tableau using the constraint coefficients, right-hand side values, and objective function coefficients.
   - Adds slack variables to convert inequalities into equalities.

2. **`printTableau`**:
   - Displays the current state of the Simplex tableau in a formatted manner.

3. **`computeCjZj`**:
   - Computes the \( C_j - Z_j \) values for non-basic variables to determine the entering variable.

4. **`findPivotColumn`**:
   - Identifies the pivot column (entering variable) based on the \( C_j - Z_j \) values.

5. **`findPivotRow`**:
   - Identifies the pivot row (leaving variable) using the minimum ratio test.

6. **`pivot`**:
   - Performs the pivot operation to update the tableau and basic variables.

7. **`solve`**:
   - Implements the Simplex Algorithm by iteratively performing pivot operations until an optimal solution is found or the problem is determined to be unbounded.

### Main Function
The `main` function handles user interaction, collects input data, and invokes the `Simplex` class to solve the problem.

---


## How It Works
1. **Input Collection**: The user provides the number of decision variables, constraints, constraint coefficients, right-hand side values, and objective function coefficients.
2. **Tableau Initialization**: The program constructs the initial Simplex tableau.
3. **Simplex Iterations**: The program iteratively performs pivot operations until an optimal solution is found or the problem is determined to be unbounded.
4. **Output**: The program displays the optimal solution, including the values of decision variables and the objective function.

## 4. Procedure for User Interaction

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Compile the Program**:
   - Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example:
     ```bash
     g++ simplex.cpp -o simplex
     ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./simplex
     ```

3. **Provide Input**:
   - Enter the following details when prompted:
     - Number of decision variables.
     - Number of constraints.
     - Coefficients of the constraints (row by row).
     - Right-hand side values of the constraints.
     - Coefficients of the objective function.
     - Type of problem (1 for maximization, 0 for minimization).

4. **View Output**:
   - The program will display the Simplex tableau at each iteration and the final optimal solution.

## 6. Conclusion

The Simplex Algorithm is a powerful tool for solving Linear Programming Problems (LPPs). This implementation provides a clear and structured approach to solving LPPs with "less than or equal to" constraints and nonnegative right-hand side values. By systematically transforming constraints into a structured tableau and iteratively improving the solution, the algorithm ensures optimality in decision-making scenarios.

The program successfully solves LP problems through systematic pivoting and iterative optimization, demonstrating the efficiency of the Simplex method in real-world applications. The C++ implementation presented in this project highlights the practical application of the Simplex method in computational problem-solving.

While the Simplex Algorithm is efficient for many real-world problems, it has limitations, such as its performance on very large datasets or cases involving degeneracy. Despite these challenges, it remains a powerful and reliable tool for linear optimization.
